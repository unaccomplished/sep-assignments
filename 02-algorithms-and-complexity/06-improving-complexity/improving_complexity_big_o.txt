Find Big-O of each version:

- code_optimized has two loops for the array to iterate through, so it has Big-O
of n*n or O(n^2)

- time_complexity has a few recursive calls (let's use 4 calls for example), so
it has Big-O of 4 log n or O(n log n).

- space_complexity will likely take longer the more arrays there are, so Big-O
is linear time or O(n).
