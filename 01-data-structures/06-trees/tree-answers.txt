2. Benchmark to compare performance between Binary Search Tree and Min Binary Heap
                                        user     system      total        real
insert numbers 1 to 10000 into tree:  17.100000   0.020000  17.120000 ( 17.129529)
insert numbers 1 to 10000 into heap:   0.030000   0.000000   0.030000 (  0.024792)
find 5000th element in tree:           0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.001131)
find 5000th element in heap:           0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000010)
remove 5000th element in tree:         0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.001059)
remove 5000th element in heap:         0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000009)

- Comparing the average insertion time for Binary Search Tree versus Min Binary
Heap shows that Min Binary Heap is more efficient.

- Comparing the time required to find the 5000th element shows that Min Binary
Heap is more efficient as well.

- Comparing the average deletion time shows that Min Binary Heap is yet again
more efficient.

- I would use Binary Search Tree for elements that I need to store and search
for quickly. The elements are inserted based on the element's rating compared to
the root, so one side of the tree can become more populated than the other side
of the tree.

- I would use Min Binary Heap for prioritizing elements because heaps keep
information organized and fills in nodes from left to right on each level of the
tree before moving to the next level. This keeps the elements more organized
and more efficient in searching/deleting.
