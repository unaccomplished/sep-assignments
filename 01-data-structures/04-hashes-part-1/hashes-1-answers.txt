Doubling the size of the underlying array in the HashClass may be a poor idea,
because this exponentially increases the size of the array when you get to a
larger sized array. This could cause fragmentation between the hash items in the
array, and will likely slow down the memory speed since doubling the size of an
array is a slow operation.
